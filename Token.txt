We store env file with JWT sign keys to create the A.T and R.T with expiry times of the tokens not keys.
We create A.T and R.T when user login but we will send only A.T to user and not R.T will store in DB for further token generation.

In Flutter need to check always first if token==null or it may have the token but older one which is invalid since it will be expired so handle it first
then get a new A.T then only hit any api by saving in local storage again,
this will remove the 401 error of unauth. user.

What if Refresh token itself got expired : Make user logut auto like after 10 days.
When user again login a new refresh token and access token will be generated taken care by backend.
Older R.T must be deleted and new one Saved in DB
